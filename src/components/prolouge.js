            I stood there on the <strong>battlefield</strong>, unable to process
            what I was seeing. So many Humans lay dead, enemies mingled with
            friends. I could see <strong>Elves</strong> and a few{" "}
            <strong>Trolls</strong>; but I had eyes only for the mangled corpses
            of my companions. I hunched my shoulders and looked at the ground. I
            didnt want to fight anymore. My eyes burned as I looked out over
            the scarred <strong>battlefield</strong>. I glanced down at myself,
            startled to see I was covered in <strong>blood</strong>; I didnt
            feel hurt. With that thought, I jolted awake. I'd had this dream
            before, many times. Each time the details changed, but the ending
            was always the same. Everyone was <strong>dead</strong>. The
            battlefield was strewn with corpses, fallen drones, broken tanks,{" "}
            <strong>residual magic</strong>. Death was the only constant. I got
            out of bed and had a drink before sitting at my desk. I glanced at
            my scarred hands, conjuring a flame before smothering it.{" "}
            <strong>Magic</strong>. All it had been was a curse, a way for
            everyone to kill each other more efficiently. Toying with a{" "}
            <strong>Writer2.1</strong> I turned it over in my hands, peering at
            the buttons. I reflected on the situation and began to record my
            thoughts.

            {" "}
            For the <strong>last century</strong> or so, I had been delving into
            magic. I was far older than I looked, thanks to it. Magic is quite
            rare here on Earth and practitioners of the art kept to themselves
            mostly, or in small enclaves and covens. We knew about the{" "}
            <strong>Vampires</strong>, of course, and interacted with them more
            often than your average Human, but even their magic has limits as
            well. But the <strong>Elves</strong> now, that brought things to a
            whole new level. At the beginning of this cursed war, it seemed like
            we Humans had the most advanced technology by centuries, and by some
            definitions we do, but their magic makes up for it. We may have{" "}
            <strong>AI</strong> driven tanks, drones, and energy weapons, but
            they have tremendous destructive power, and I am just scratching the
            surface in understanding what they are capable of. Still, going back
            to those limits we seemed to have before the Elven people showed up;
            I pushed those limits more and more in my lust for power and
            knowledge. I was determined to become more <strong>powerful</strong>{" "}
            than anyone had ever been, to know all there was to know about magic
            and, largely, I have succeeded. But this has come with a cost.
            Nothing in this world, or any other is truly free. And that brings
            us back to those damned prideful <strong>Elves </strong> and this
            fucking war.

            I paused the recording for a moment, running a hand through my hair
            and sighing. Making this <strong>record</strong> wasn’t enough,
            though I was determined to record everything; someone had to know
            the truth. But I had to do more, didn’t I? I had to fix this-maybe I
            am the only one who can. I glanced at the device, a spark of hope
            burning in my heart. There had to be others who felt the same. I had
            already started putting out feelers, searching; there might even be{" "}
            <strong>someone</strong>
            who can get me an audience with the Elves. But that was tomorrow; I
            could do nothing more now but record. Playing back what I had just
            <strong> dictated</strong>, I toyed with the buttons, considering
            all that had happened. I’ve already recorded my long journey through
            magic, and all that I have learned and discovered; but I had never
            really explained this <strong>war</strong>.{" "}

            Some years ago, amid our own ongoing problems, a crisis of
            unforeseen magnitude arrived in our world. Driven away from their
            home by their own magical <strong>calamity</strong>, the Elves and
            their peoples invaded our world instead. They seized control of a
            huge landmass and refused all the feeble attempts at{" "}
            <strong>diplomacy</strong>, defending to the death their new home.
            They intend on controlling this “new world” the way they did theirs.
            We <strong>retaliated</strong>, of course, trying to regain the land
            that they stole from us. As powerful as I was, I felt I could not
            sit back and do nothing. I tried to reason with both sides. Even
            used threats. I warned them of my <strong>premonitions</strong>.
            Nothing worked. Politicians and leaders on both sides were
            determined to use this conflict for their own{" "}
            <strong>agendas</strong>. No one could prevent war. A vivid dream
            came to me many times now, and I am convinced the threat is real.
            There is something worse coming, much worse. If we do not stop this
            pointless fighting, if we do not unite and learn to live in peace,
            not a single one of us will survive this threat. Humans, Elves,
            Trolls, Fairies, we will all be <strong>wiped</strong> out.

            I put down the Writer2.1 with a <strong>frustrated</strong> sigh.
            This wasn't the entire story, not by far, but there was no time for
            that now; I needed to get a little rest-I had places to be early. I
            was supposed to meet with my contact and make my way to see the
            Elves. She had better show up after all that I’ve been through. I
            sowed the start of the growing <strong>resistance</strong> against
            this war and was determined to see it through, and to find any
            others who felt the same. They had to, or all was{" "}
            <strong>lost</strong>.
